# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to

Change default port value in application.properties

## JPA Entities

### FoodOption
This table is a simple editable enumeration of possible options. Each option
is available for multiple menu items. For example, olives could go on a pizza or a submarine sandwich.

### MenuItemOption
A MenuItemOption links a MenuItem (below) to a Food Option. It also has a delta price, which is the amount the price changes if the guest chooses this option.

### MenuItem
A MenuItem consists of a name, price, and list of MenuItemOptions. The list consists of all possible options for this menu item. MenuItem has a One-to-Many relationship with MenuItemOption.

### FoodOrder
A Food order is an actual order. It has a final price, a boolean to record when it has been completed and delivered, and an order date and completion date, and a list of MenuItemOptions. Unlike the MenuItem, the list of options is all the chosen options, rather than the available options. Also, unlike MenuItem, the FoodOrder has a Many-To-Many relationship with MenuItemOption.

### Money values
Monetary values are expressed as Strings in the DTOs, because the toolkit I'm using (swagger) converts floats and doubles to java's Float and Double type, instead of BigDecimal. Using Strings lets me convert them to BigDecimal in a reliable way.
